# @baton/sdk (TypeScript)

*The TypeScript counterpart to [`baton-sdk`](https://github.com/good-timing/baton) (Python) — structured signal capture for agent-mediated tool use over MCP.*

**Status: Phase 1 scaffold, pre-publish.** This package currently ships the wire-format core only — event types and sinks. It does **not** yet capture anything: the MCP tool-handler interceptor (`withBaton`) that Python's `install_baton(mcp, ...)` has is Phase 2, not built. Don't install this expecting it to instrument a server today.

## Why this exists

Most production MCP servers are TypeScript, not Python — see the [design note](https://github.com/good-timing/baton-internal) (private) for the motivating research. `baton-sdk` (Python) can't reach that half of the ecosystem. This package is the TS-native way in, wire-compatible with the Python SDK by construction (see [Wire compatibility](#wire-compatibility) below).

## What's here

- `Event` — a Zod-validated discriminated union over the five event types (`tool_call_start`, `tool_call_end`, `tool_call_error`, `annotation`, `surface_snapshot`), field-for-field with the Python SDK's Pydantic models.
- `StdoutSink` — JSONL to a writable stream (default `process.stderr` — MCP stdio transport reserves stdout for JSON-RPC framing).
- `HttpSink` — `POST {url}/v0/events` with bearer auth, bounded buffer, retry with backoff, circuit breaker. The contract any Baton-compatible collector consumes.

`FileSink` / `MultiSink` and the MCP interceptor are deliberately not here yet — see "What's deferred" in the design note.

## Wire compatibility

This is the load-bearing constraint (per [CHARTER](https://github.com/good-timing/baton/blob/main/docs/CHARTER.md) §3 rule 3): TS-emitted events must be JSON-identical in shape to Python-emitted ones, so the Console never has to branch on which SDK produced an event. `baton-spec` (submoduled at `baton-spec/`) is the neutral schema repo both SDKs are checked against — `test/conformance.test.ts` validates every event type against `baton-spec/events.schema.json` (ajv) and round-trips the real, Python-captured fixtures in `baton-spec/vectors/*.json` through this package's Zod schemas byte-for-byte.

## Development

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/good-timing/baton-ts.git
cd baton-ts
npm install
npm run ci   # lint + typecheck + test + build — the canonical gate, matches CI
```

If you cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, run `git submodule update --init` before `npm test` — the conformance tests read fixtures from `baton-spec/`.

## Canonical docs

This repo has no `CHARTER.md`/`SPEC.md` of its own — those live in [`baton`](https://github.com/good-timing/baton) (`docs/CHARTER.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`) and apply here too. Read those before making architectural changes to this package.
